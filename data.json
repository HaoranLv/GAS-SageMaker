I have not decided where I will put the lamp but I’m glad I purchased it. Had to struggle with one that was lost but Amazon made that right by sending another. Others have complained about the shade but that was very simple to put together. It looks like a quality item especially when compared to floor lamps I’ve seen on the floor at stores like Home Goods or Lowes. I’m happy with it. "
